- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @the-password-is-password
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in operating systems, primarily. However, I do like to explore around just for fun.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic computer science principles, programming languages and whatever I can find to help me create (or at least contribute some addition to) an operating system.
